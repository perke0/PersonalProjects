# Person-Car-Both_Detection-SimpleApp
Default videos are from youtube
The application is not complicated at all. Of course, it has some GUI.
All readings are not 100% accurate, but they are not random. 
You can choose whether people, cars, or both will search for you. 
You can insert your pictures or videos.
If you don't insert anything, each option has a default video downloaded from youtube. I hope they don't have a copyright. 
If you do not have the cv2 module then find it on the web as a download for the appropriate version of your Python. 
Enjoy using it.
